# Non-Invasive-Sugar-Monitor

In recent years, with the rise of global diabetes, a growing number of subjects are suffering from pain and infections caused by the invasive nature of mainstream commercial glucose meters. Diabetes is one kind of disease of the pancreas, which is responsible for producing a hormone called insulin. Diabetes happens when the pancreas gland is no longer able to produce insulin or the body cannot properly utilize the insulin delivered by the pancreas, resulting in the high level of blood glucose in the bloodstream.


Developing a technology that can accurately and reliably measure blood glucose levels without the need for invasive procedures such as finger pricks or blood draws. 
A non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system would offer an alternative, more comfortable way to monitor blood glucose levels, which could improve diabetes management and overall quality of life for people with the condition. 


1. Knowing about components:

2. Datset Collection

A database is created spot on from various locations and from various age groups and gender included within the  same file refer to .CSV file for proceding further
database can be further extended for better accuracy.
